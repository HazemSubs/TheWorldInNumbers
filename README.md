Project: The World In Numbers

The world in numbers is a group project I worked on during one of my university courses. Purpose The World in Numbers is a program that retrieves, processes, and renders demographic and other data for countries from the World Bank’s data repository. It will process, analyze and render data with the aim of exhibiting itself in understandable means for the user. The general purpose is to provide a user (researcher or others) with a simple to use interface to display data trends. The interface allows the user to select their desired data requirements without having to browse through The World Bank’s vast amount of data.

The objective of the project is to implement a system that has a main user interface where users can select the country, year range, viewer(s) and data analysis method(s). The retrieved and processed data will be rendered using appropriately selected visualization, including various charts and graphs. The system allows for data to be fetched from the World Bank’s data base by remote issuing HTTP GET requests via the Java application.

Overall, the system provides the user with an easy way to select their own data filters from available World Bank data to collect/analyze data. The system then uses the available data (even if the desired data is not fully available e.g., a year within range has no data available) to display it in several statistical tools which are chosen by the user from a pool of available analyses methods (e.g., pie charts).
